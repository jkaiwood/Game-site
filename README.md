# Game-site

This is a game site with more than one game that help display my knowledge of Javascript. The Dice game has 2 dice (Player 1 & Player 2) that randomly 
change to different sides. Whichever one of the 2 have a higher value get the message that they won.
The Drum kit uses event listeners to play the sound of the corresponding drum button. The keyboard and the mouse can be used to play this game.
